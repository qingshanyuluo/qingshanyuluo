### 👋 Hello, I'm qingshanyuluo

**Architecting the Digital Workforce in Shanghai.**

I am an INTP developer obsessed with the **"Execution Layer"** of Artificial Intelligence. I believe the future lies not just in smarter models, but in models that can *use* computers as humans do.

#### 🔭 Research & Dev Focus
* **From Text to Action:** Moving beyond RAG to true **Computer Use**—enabling AI to control software, browsers, and terminals.
* **AIOps Evolution:** Transitioning from rule-based alerts to agentic problem solving.
* **Efficiency:** Optimizing agent decision-making loops for minimal latency and maximum reliability.

#### 🌱 Activity
- Building robust **Agentic Workflows**.
- Exploring the boundaries of **Visual Grounding** in UI automation.

#### 💞️ Collaboration
Open to deep-dive discussions on **Agent Reliability** and **Pattern Abstraction**.
